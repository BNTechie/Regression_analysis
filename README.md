# Regression analysis

Key Concepts in Regression Analysis

Dependent Variable (Y): The outcome or the variable we are trying to predict or explain.
Independent Variable(s) (X): The predictors or factors that influence the dependent variable.
Regression Line: A line that best fits the data points in a scatter plot, showing the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
Coefficients: Values that quantify the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
Intercept: The expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero.
